# :white_flower: Japanese Kanji Revisions :white_flower:
Here is the code I made in my spare time to create an application I use to study/review Japanese Kanji that I learned.

It is possible that your antivirus is causing you **problems**. I developed this application myself, so you shouldn't have any problems with the executable.

If you need, please download **"Japonais - Installer.exe"** directly.

Each image is drawn randomly in a folder among all the kanji that I currently know

Application detail:
  - the number of the kanji you are at, with the total number
  - a search bar (which will be modified to work correctly) which displays all the words that have the characters you write
  - information such as image, hiragana script, pronunciation, translation and stroke count of the kanji
  - buttons to show/hide the image and information
  - shortcuts for the buttons (they are displayed when the mouse remains on a button for a while) (W to check all)
  - when you reach the end of the series, a message appears to start a new one

Good Bye :wave::wave::wave:
